      This frontend is part of a deliberately vulnerable application designed for testing and educational purposes.
      It should focus on vulnerabilities specific to client-side code, such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and improper
      handling of user inputs. Pay special attention to the sanitization and encoding of user inputs to prevent XSS attacks.
      Additionally, ensure that sensitive data is not exposed through the Document Object Model (DOM) or browser storage
      mechanisms like localStorage or sessionStorage. Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to add an extra layer of
      protection against client-side attacks. Regularly review and update third-party libraries to address any known
      vulnerabilities that could affect the frontend.
  - type: "false_positive"
    description: >
      This section outlines scenarios where security alerts in the frontend may be considered false positives
      due to specific user interactions or design choices. For example, certain UI components might use inline
      scripts or styles for dynamic content updates, which could be misinterpreted as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
      attempts. Additionally, single-page applications often make frequent API calls that could trigger alerts
      for unusual network activity. Understanding these frontend-specific nuances is crucial for distinguishing
      between genuine threats and benign activities that align with our user experience and design requirements.
